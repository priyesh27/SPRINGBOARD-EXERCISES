# Ultimate-Challenge
A takehome exercise for analyzing activity trends over time, designing an A/B test, and predicting user retention.

The pdf describes the challenge, the data, and the tasks expected.

The notebook has three parts.
Part 1 has an analysis of activity as it varies with time.
Part 2 describes a possible A/B test to encourage drivers to work between cities.
Part 3 wrangles the data and builds predicitive models to identify which factors are most important for user retention and suggests future efforts to increase retention.
